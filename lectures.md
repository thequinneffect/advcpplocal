## scope
* the scope of a variable is the part of the program where it is accessible
* scope starts at variable definition (you obviously can't use something that is undefined because, well, it doesn't exist before it is defined)
  * remember that declaration does not allocate any memory, definition does, hence definition is the actual point at which the declared thing exists
