## scope
* the scope of a variable is the part of the program where it is accessible
* scope starts at variable definition (you obviously can't use something that is undefined because, well, it doesn't exist before it is defined)
  * remember that declaration does not allocate any memory, definition does, hence definition is the actual point at which the declared thing exists
* scope usually ends at the next closing brace "}" (but it won't in some cases e.g. global variable, static variable)
* define variables as close to first use as possible (WOO! finally some sense! 1511 "all vars at top of file" style sucks ass)
